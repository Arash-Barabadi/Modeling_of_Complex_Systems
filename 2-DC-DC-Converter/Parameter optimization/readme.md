# Parameteroptimierung (Parameter optimization)
## After the first simulations, we notice small differences between simulation and real measurements.

## Why?
## We ignored some real effects (e.g., cable losses, diode nonlinearities).
## The real components (L, C, R) are never exactly equal to the datasheet nominal values.
## Solution: Adjust the parameters in the model so simulation matches measurements better.
