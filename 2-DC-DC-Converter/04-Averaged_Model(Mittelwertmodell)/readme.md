## Why is this a problem in HiL?

# So ...
### Most voltage controllers care about the slow, average settling of  Ua not the microsecond-scale ripple. The average model captures what the controller needs while being light enough to run on the ESP32 in HiL.

# What does the averaged model do with these poles?
### It removes the fast pole (high-frequency switching LC dynamics).
### It often even ignores the second pole and just keeps the static gain (P-element).
### This makes the model much simpler: instead of oscillations, you just get the average DC voltage response.
# What is the deduction process of math of the P-gain element?

### Normalize denominator ‚Üí standard second-order form...

### Compare with standard PT-2 form:

# Therefore:
### We keep only the static gain
