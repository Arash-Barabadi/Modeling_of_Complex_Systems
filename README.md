## 2- DC-DC-Wandler (DC-DC converter)
### This project models and simulates a PWM-controlled DCâ€“DC converter using an LC filter and nonlinear load, with the duty cycle generated by a sawtooth-comparator method.
### Lookup tables from measured bulb characteristics are used to represent the load resistance dynamically.
